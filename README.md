## Algorithms
I'm working on adding more implementations constantly. Currently, I've planned
to implement the following algorithms:

### Sorting
- **Quadratic: O(n^2)**
  - [X] Selection Sort
  - [X] Insertion Sort
  - [X] Bubble Sort
  - [ ] Shaker Sort

- **Logarithmic: O(n * log n)**
  - [X] Merge Sort
  - [X] Quick Sort

- **Linear: O(n)**
  - [ ] Counting Sort

### Searching
- [X] Binary Search
- [X] Recursive Binary Search


## Data Structures
As I learn more, I'll add new implementations here. Currently, these are the structures that I've planned:

### Array-based Structures
- [X] Stack
- [X] Queue
- [X] Circular Queue
- [ ] Hash Table

### Node-based Structures
- [X] Singly Linked List (SLL)
- [ ] Double Linked List (DLL)
- [ ] Stack with SLL
- [ ] Queue with DLL

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dougdomingos/DSA-Java.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. Explore the `src` directory to find the algorithms you're interested in.

4. Run the JUnit tests to validate the correctness of implementations.
