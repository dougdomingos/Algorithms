## Algorithms
I'm working on adding more implementations constantly. Currently, I've planned
to implement the following algorithms:

### Sorting
- **Quadratic: O(nÂ²)**
  - [X] Selection Sort
  - [X] Insertion Sort
  - [ ] Bubble Sort
  - [ ] Shaker Sort


- **Logarithmic: O(n log n)**
  - [ ] Merge Sort
  - [X] Quick Sort


- **Linear: O(n)**
  - [ ] Counting Sort

### Searching
- [X] Binary Search
- [X] Recursive Binary Search

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dougdomingos/Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. Explore the `src` directory to find the algorithms you're interested in.

4. Run the JUnit tests to validate the correctness of implementations.
