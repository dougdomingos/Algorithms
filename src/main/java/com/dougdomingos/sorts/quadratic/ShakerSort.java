/**
 * Shaker Sort.
 * Shaker Sort, also known as Bidirectional Bubble Sort or Cocktail Shaker Sort,
 * is a variation of the Bubble Sort
 * algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing
 * adjacent elements in both directions, and
 * swapping them if they are in the wrong order until the entire array is
 * sorted.
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2) | Space Complexity: O(1) Stability: Stable
