/**
 * This package provides a range of sorting algorithms, classified into packages
 * by their time complexity class.
 * <p>
 * The sorting algorithms are classified into packages by their time complexity,
 * as follows:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Linear: algorithms with worst-case time complexity of O(n)
 *   <li>Quadratic: algorithms with worst-case time complexity of O(n^2)
 *   <li>Logarithmic: algorithms with worst-case time complexity of O(n * log n)
 * </ul>
