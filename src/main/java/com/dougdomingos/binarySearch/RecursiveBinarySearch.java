 * Recursive Binary Search.
 * <p>
 * The Binary Search algorithm, given a previously sorted array, works by
 * successfully dividing the array by half. Then,
 * it has three conditions:
 * - If the middle value is less than the target, repeat the binary search to
 * the left half of the array
 * - If the middle value is greater than the target, repeat the binary search to
 * the right half of the array
 * - If the middle value is equal to the target, return the index of the value
 * This implementation uses the recursive approach.
